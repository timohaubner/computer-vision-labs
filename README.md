# Computer Vision Labs

This repository contains **selected lab work** from a Computer Vision course.  
It is mainly here as a **personal portfolio / showcase** to document my progress.

## Scope & Notes

- The code and materials in this repo are my results for the lab parts of a Computer Vision course.
- This repository is not an official course distribution and is not intended for reuse of course content.
- I do not claim any rights to the original course material; the assignment documents are not uploaded.
